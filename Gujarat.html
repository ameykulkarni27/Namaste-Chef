                RECIPE: 
               
              
              
                <p> </p><hr>
                Making Khaman Batter 
                Grease a steamer pan with 2 to 3 teaspoons of oil.
                Take besan or gram flour in a mixing bowl or pan. <hr>
                Add turmeric powder, asafoetida, lemon juice, ginger paste, green chilies paste, sugar, oil and salt.
                Add 1 cup water or as required to make thick yet flowing water. The amount of water required depends on the quality of flour, so add as required. <hr>
                Stir and then add the rava or sooji (semolina).
                Stir to a smooth thick batter without any lumps. <hr>
                The batter should be thick yet flowing. A quick tip is that if the batter become thin, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons besan. 
                Bring to a boil 2 to 2.5 cups of water in a steamer pan or electric cooker or a stove-top pressure cooker. 
                The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker. <hr>
                Now add the eno or fruit salt to the batter.
                Stir briskly and quickly. The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.
                The batter would froth and become bubbly, so you have to be quick. <hr>
                Pour the batter in the greased pan.
                Steaming Khaman Dhokla <hr>
                Place the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the batter. When using pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid
                Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to high heat. <hr>
                To check the doneness, insert a toothpick and if it comes out clean, the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for some more time.
                When the khaman become lukewarm or cool, then with a butter knife gently slid along the edges. Keep a plate or tray on top of the pan.
                Invert the pan. If greased well, the khaman will easily get inverted on the plate. Slice and keep aside. <hr>
                Tempering Dhokla
                In a small pan, heat oil.
                Add mustard seeds and let them to crackle. <hr>
                When the mustard seeds are crackling, add the cumin seeds (optional), curry leaves and chopped green chilies (optional).
                Stir and then add sesame seeds.
                Fry the sesame seeds for some seconds but do not brown them. <hr>
                Then add water. Be careful while adding water as the mixture sizzles. You can switch off the heat when adding water.
                Add sugar. Stir and allow the tempering mixture to come to a boil. Make sure that the sugar has dissolved in the water.
                Then pour this tempering mixture evenly on the steamed and sliced khaman. <hr>
                Garnish with chopped coriander seeds and grated coconut.
                Serve khaman dhokla straight away or you can store them in an air tight box and then serve later after some minutes or an hour.
                If serving khaman after many hours, then do not garnish with coconut and coriander leaves. <hr>

                <p> </p><hr>
                Kneading Dough
                Rinse 1 cup methi leaves very well in water. Then drain them and chop finely.
                In a mixing bowl, take whole wheat flour, besan, sorghum flour and pearl millet flour. I have used millet flours but you can skip them if you don’t have. In this case, simply add 1.25 cups whole wheat flour and ½ cup besan.
                Add all the spices and herbs. <hr>
                Add the chopped methi leaves. Mix everything well.
                Add curd (for a vegan option add very little water instead of curd). <hr>
                Mix again and knead into a dough. Don’t add water while kneading as methi leaves release water.
                Knead to a soft and smooth dough. Add more curd if needed while kneading. <hr> 
                Rolling To Flatbreads
                Make medium sized balls from the dough. <hr>
                Take a medium sized ball and sprinkle some flour on it.
                With the rolling pin begin to roll the thepla.
                Roll them to a round of about 5 to 6 inches in diameter. <hr>
                Cooking Thepla
                On a hot tawa or skillet, place the thepla. Flip when one side is partly cooked, about one-fourth or half cooked. You will see some faint air pockets on the top and this is the time when you need to flip it.
                Spread oil on this side. Flip the thepla again when the second side is half-cooked. <hr>
                Now spread the oil on this side. Flip a couple of times till you get golden spots and the methi thepla is cooked evenly.
                You can also press the thepla with spatula while cooking.
                Remove and keep it in a roti basket.
                Serve methi thepla hot or warm or at room temperature. <hr>

                Making Khandvi Batter
                Take the yogurt in a bowl. Add water and stir well till smooth.
                Add ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt. <hr>
                If using fresh yogurt, then to add the sourness, add about ½ tsp of lemon juice.
                Add the gram flour/besan. With a wired whisk, keep on stirring and mixing till all the lumps are dissolved and you get a smooth batter. There should be no lumps in the batter. You can also use a hand held beater to mix the batter.
                Spread oil on plates or boards or tray. Large steel lids or thalis work very well. You can also use the back of a large baking tray or your kitchen counter top. <hr>
                Also mix the chopped coriander leaves and grated coconut. Keep aside.
                Pour the batter in a sauce pan or a broad frying pan. Switch on the stove top and keep the flame to the lowest. Begin to stir.
                Keep on stirring when the khandvi batter is getting heated up. Lumps begin to form and you have to continuously stir so that the lumps don’t form. <hr>
                The batter would thicken and keep on thickening. Keep on stirring. Best to use a wooden spatula or a heat proof silicon spatula.
                The batter also should not be allowed to stick at the bottom. So you have to stir continuously.
                Do a plate test when the batter has thickened well. <hr>
                Spread a few teaspoons of the batter on a greased plate. Let it cool a bit and then begin to roll. If you are unable to roll, then the batter needs to be cooked more.
                The final consistency of the khandvi batter is shown in pic 17 below. It took me 17 minutes to get the correct consistenc
                Making Khandvi Rolls <hr>
                Quickly pour about ½ to ⅔ cup of batter on a large plate and spread thinly &amp; evenly with a spatula. You have to be quick with the remaining batter too. Since even a bit of cooling and the batter becomes likes blob, difficult to spread.
                Allow to cool and then sprinkle the coconut + coriander leaves mixture sparingly. You can also skip this stuffing part and directly garnish with the coconut and coriander once you temper the khandvi rolls.
                Cut into equal sized strips. <hr>
                Gently roll each strip tightly. Then place them in a serving tray or plate.if the tray or plate is large, then you will get large rolls. In this case after you finish rolling half, just cut horizontally and make a second roll.
                Arrange the khandvi rolls next to each other or stack them up neatly in a plate or tray.
                Tempering (Seasoning) For Khandvi <hr>
                Heat oil and crackle the mustard seeds.
                Then add curry leaves, green chilies and fry for a few seconds.
                Add the sesame seeds and when they change color &amp; crackle, pour <hr> the hot tempering mixture along with the oil on the khandvi rolls evenly.
                You can garnish it with some more coconut and coriander leaves, if you prefer. Serve khandvi with coriander chutney or coriander mint chutney.

            <p> </p><hr>
            Making Dough
            In a bowl or parat (large plate with rims at the sides) take 1 cup besan (gram flour).
            Add carom seeds (ajwain), crushed black pepper, turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). Also add ⅛ teaspoon baking soda or 2 to 3 pinches of baking soda.
            Mix very well with a spoon.
            Now add ¾ teaspoon salt or add as per taste. <hr>
            Add 2 to 3 tablespoons water in parts.
            Begin to mix the water with the besan. Then knead to a tight dough.
            Now add 2 tablespoons oil. Mix again and continue to knead. <hr>
            Also add water if required. Initially I added 3 tablespoons water and after adding oil, added 1 tablespoon water. So in total I used 4 tablespoons water. Depending on the quality of besan, you can add a total of 3 to 4 tablespoons of water
            Ct dough. So Knead till you get a soft smooth dough. Cover and keep aside the dough for 30 minutes.
            Rolling Fafda <hr>
            After 30 minutes, make small balls from the dough. Cover them with a lid or a kitchen towel so that they do not become dry.
            On a wooden board spread oil very lightly.  <hr>
            Now with the heels of your palms, with a light pressure and force, press and flatten the dough ball and at the same time move the palms forward. 
            If you apply too much pressure then fafda will stick to board and will break while lifti
           Then with a knife cut strips and remove them.
            Keep it on a separate plate which has been greased lightly with oil. Make fafda this way with the remaining dough balls. Cover with a kitchen napkin so that they do not become dry.
            Frying Fafda <hr>
            Heat oil in a kadai. When the oil becomes medium hot, check a small tiny piece of the dough. It should gradually come up on top of the oil.
          
            Do not overcrowd the kadai. Depending on the size of the kadai, you can add 3 to 4 pieces at a time.
            Begin to fry at a low-medium flame. <hr>
            When one side is crisp and golden, then with a slotted spoon gently turn over each fafda and continue to fry.
            Turn over again and fry till crisp. Do not fry till too much browned. Fafda gets fried quickly, so the frying needs attention.
            Remove with a slotted spoon draining excess oil. <hr>
            Place them on kitchen paper towels for extra oil to be absorbed.
            Serve them warm or at room temperature with papaya sambharo or fafda chutney or gujarati kadhi. Or you can also enjoy the combo of fafda jalebi.
