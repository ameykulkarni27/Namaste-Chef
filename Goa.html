                  First defrost prawns by either keeping them in water at room temperature water for 30 minutes or transfer the frozen prawns in the fridge compartment from the freezer. This will also thaw the prawns for using them the next day.
                Next, add and mix all ingredients listed above in a big bowl and add thawed prawns in that bowl. <hr> Keep them in the marinade for 10 minutes if you are in hurry. However If you have time, keeping these marinated prawns for longer than hour would make tandoori prawns even tastier.
                After that skew these prawns on to skewers and cook them using any of the above mentioned methods. <br> You can use an oven or grill on a stove top as per your choice. Both processes are explained below:
                Tandoori Prawns in an Oven
                Preheat the oven at 200C. <hr>
                Brush marinated prawns with oil and grill for 10 Minutes. Actual time may vary from 9-12 minutes depending on the size of prawns you are using.
                Brush them with melted butter after cooking for that extra flavor if you like that, or serve them hot as it is. <br>
                Tandoori Prawn Recipe- Stove top Method
                If you do not want to use an oven, simply make them over stove top. <hr>
                Heat a grill pan brush it with oil. When it is hot, place marinated prawn skewers and grill on medium heat for 2-3 minutes.
                Then increase the heat and allow them to cook till they are slightly charred for that smoky flavour. <br>
                Once done, sprinkle some chaat masala and serve them with sauce/chutney of your choice.

                Grind green chilli, grated coconut, chopped coriander and garlic into a thick paste. Don‚Äôt add water while grinding. Finely chopped onions can be added to the mixture after grinding.

              Rinse mushrooms in water a few times using a colander or strainer. Trim the bottom part of the stalks and chop the mushrooms. Discard these.
            Slice the onions thinly, slit the green chilies.
            Making Mushroom Fry </p><hr>
                
            Heat oil in a pan or kadai (wok).
            Add the onions and saut√© stirring often till they begin to get light golden.
            This process of cooking onions takes a lot of time. So, to quicken it, add a pinch of salt to the onions. This helps the onions to cook faster. <br>
            The onions should have softness in them. So, when you see them beginning to get light golden, proceed to the next step. Don't make the onions crisp or browned.
            Add the green chilies and saut√© for half a minute. <hr>
            Now, add the chopped mushrooms and stir.
            Add all the ground spice powders including salt as required.
           <hr>
            Saut√© the mushrooms till they shrink in size and leave water.
            Continue to cook till all the water has evaporated and you can see oil in the mixture.
            Saut√© till the mushrooms turn light golden. The mixture should be dry. <hr>
            Add coriander leaves. Stir and cook for a minute.
            Switch off the heat and serve Mushroom Fry hot or warm with roti, bread or dinner rolls. <hr>

              Rinse mushrooms in water a few times using a colander or strainer. Trim the bottom part of the stalks and chop the mushrooms. Discard these.
            Slice the onions thinly, slit the green chilies.
            Making Mushroom Fry </p><hr>
                
            Heat oil in a pan or kadai (wok).
            Add the onions and saut√© stirring often till they begin to get light golden.
            This process of cooking onions takes a lot of time. So, to quicken it, add a pinch of salt to the onions. This helps the onions to cook faster. <br>
            The onions should have softness in them. So, when you see them beginning to get light golden, proceed to the next step. Don't make the onions crisp or browned.
            Add the green chilies and saut√© for half a minute. <hr>
            Now, add the chopped mushrooms and stir.
            Add all the ground spice powders including salt as required.
            <hr>
            Saut√© the mushrooms till they shrink in size and leave water.
            Continue to cook till all the water has evaporated and you can see oil in the mixture.
            Saut√© till the mushrooms turn light golden. The mixture should be dry. <hr>
            Add coriander leaves. Stir and cook for a minute.
            Switch off the heat and serve Mushroom Fry hot or warm with roti, bread or dinner rolls. <hr>
